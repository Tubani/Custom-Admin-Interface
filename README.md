Afterwards as mentioned in the README.rst, include the "customAdmin" app inside your INSTALLED_APPS . One important thing is that, it is needed to be written before "django.contrib.admin" in order to work.

# Functionality
The package is very simple. If you use this package in your app the default styling of the admin page will be changed.
